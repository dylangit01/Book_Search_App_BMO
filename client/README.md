# Book Search Master

## Introduction
[BookSearchMaster](https://booksearchmaster.netlify.app) is a web application that accepts a title as a parameter. The application should then return book results, and for each book should display the following information:
-	Title
-	Book Cover
-	Author
-	Published Date

## MVP: https://booksearchmaster.netlify.app

## Built With
BookSearchMaster was built using JavaScript, CSS, HTML, React, Redux, Node, Express, and the Open Library API.

## Wish-List Features
There were a few features that I was unable to implement in this app due to time limitation. Further work on this app would include:

- [ ] Build pagination for the search results
- [ ] Add a "Search by Author" option
- [ ] write more tests for app
- [ ] Refactor some other actions using redux
